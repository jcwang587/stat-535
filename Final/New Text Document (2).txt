1. The slides is clear and informative. The presentation is also very clear and easy to follow and understand. The analysis combining positive and negative words from opinion lexicon is also very innovative.

3. Apply several analysis and predictor methods on the movie dataset and explain clearly. Better apply more Boostraping or monte carlo method in analysis.
